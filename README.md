## Hi World, I'm Lucas Gonze

I'm a TPM with career-long involvement in open source. I make my living advising corporate clients including New Relic, Toyota, eBay, and Meta on how to thrive in the FOSS environment. I am on the Technical Steering Committee for [Magma](https://magmacore.org/). My most recent contributions - big and small, paid and unpaid - were to [OpenChain](https://github.com/OpenChain-Project), [pin-github-action](https://github.com/mheap/pin-github-action), [OWASP](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/), [Magma](magmacore.org/), [fbjs](https://github.com/facebook/fbjs), [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook), [XSPF](https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/xspf-website), [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.info/), [Merico Build](https://github.com/merico-dev/build), and [The COVID Tracking Project](https://github.com/orgs/COVID19Tracking/dashboard). I am a member of [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) and [OSI](https://opensource.org/).

In my private life I make music, and since a lot of it is in the public domain I post [my transcriptions here on Github](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Agithub.com+lucasgonze+music&ia=web) using open formats like Lilypond and Musescore.
