## Hi World, I'm Lucas Gonze

I build software, mostly as a product manager. I believe the best products are created in a dialogue with the market and the developers, finding a natural match between vision and possibility. I can code and Iâ€™m good with data. I love UX. I can manage engineers and lead Agile teams. Early in my career, I was in QA. All of it is relevant.

Lately I'm working on [Merico Build](https://merico.build). It's a super interesting project. 

My most recent open source contributions were to [The COVID Tracking Project](https://github.com/orgs/COVID19Tracking/dashboard). The biggest thing I have been a maintainer for is [XSPF](http://xspf.org).

The best way to reach me is email to lucas@gonze.com. Tweets are (@lucas_gonze)[https://twitter.com/lucas_gonze]. (My LinkedIn)[https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasgonze/] might be handy. For encrypted messaging, use lucasgonze on Keybase or lucasgonze@protonmail.ch.

In my private life I make music, and since a lot of it is in the public domain I post my transcriptions here on Github.
