## Hi World, I'm Lucas Gonze

I'm a technical product manager with a love of open source. My most recent contributions, big or small, paid or unpaid, were to [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.info/), [The Book of Secret Knowledge](https://github.com/trimstray/the-book-of-secret-knowledge), [Merico Build](https://github.com/merico-dev/build), and [The COVID Tracking Project](https://github.com/orgs/COVID19Tracking/dashboard). The biggest open source project I have led is [XSPF](http://xspf.org).

The best way to reach me is email to lucas@gonze.com. Tweets are [@lucas_gonze](https://twitter.com/lucas_gonze). [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasgonze/) might be what you're looking for. For encrypted messaging, use lucasgonze on Keybase or lucasgonze@protonmail.ch.

In my private life I make music, and since a lot of it is in the public domain I post [my transcriptions here on Github](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Agithub.com+lucasgonze+music&ia=web) using open formats like Lilypond and Musescore.
