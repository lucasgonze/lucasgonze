## Hi World, I'm Lucas Gonze

Lately I'm working on [Merico Build](https://merico.build), where I'm a technical PM thinking a lot about OSS in the time of social media. 

My most recent open source contributions were to [The COVID Tracking Project](https://github.com/orgs/COVID19Tracking/dashboard). The biggest thing I have been a maintainer for is [XSPF](http://xspf.org).

The best way to reach me is email to lucas@gonze.com. Tweets are [@lucas_gonze](https://twitter.com/lucas_gonze). [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasgonze/) might be what you're looking for. For encrypted messaging, use lucasgonze on Keybase or lucasgonze@protonmail.ch.

In my private life I make music, and since a lot of it is in the public domain I post my transcriptions here on Github using open formats like Lilypond and Musescore.
